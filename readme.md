# SEI Flex 44 - Building a Javascript Calculator Lab

##### The task for this deliverable was to recreate the design and basic functionality of a web calculator. The requirements were:

- a wireframe image detailing our plan for the layout's HTML and CSS
- our code was to follow the layout including button orientation and order

##### The required behaviour was:

- should be able to perform simple arithmatic (no bedmas)
- should be able to show a result when = is pressed
- should be able to clear the result if clear is pressed
- should clear previous result when a user starts again
- should be clear of any test code including console.logs etc.

##### The bonus functionality was:

- to make the calculator mobile friendly (responsive design)
- to implement layout change for both large and small screen transitions (change in width)

##### Screenshots of my final design are shown here:
